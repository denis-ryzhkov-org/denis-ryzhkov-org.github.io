I've always wanted to have a cam in my eye<br />
when I bump into a moment<br />
I would regret I have not stored.<br />
<br />
Thanks to the dream I am in future.<br />
There is no Google or Facebook or any other corp here anymore,<br />
but there is the Corp here.<br />
It does not have any other name, just the Corp.<br />
<br />
And thanks to the Corp everyone here have modified DNA<br />
and updates are installed over the air without opt out, by law.<br />
<br />
Me was no exception,<br />
I've got patched as soon as I dropped into the time.<br />
<br />
However something went wrong and I have returned to my native time,<br />
partially rolling back the patch.<br />
<br />
While I was trying to get myself stable,<br />
suddenly the Glass opened in front of me but inside my mind.<br />
Strange almost-triangular form like an upper piece of a wide flat ring.<br />
<br />
Narrated voice inside my head,<br />
breaking through bugs caused by the partial rollback, told me:<br />
<br />
- Some memories are recovered from your brain and are extrapolated in a fun way.<br />
Please enjoy.<br />
<br />
Then I have seen in the Glass some of those moments I always wanted I could store,<br />
but sometimes followed by something that never happened, ill joke of that code I guess.<br />
<br />
There was a friend of mine laughing with the beams of sun going through her hair.<br />
Social profile link was attached and mind-clickable. But before I clicked it...<br />
<br />
...all switched to my pet turtle (dead few years ago), moving its head in its own way.<br />
Then I have seen some creatures behind my turtle, knowing they are the turtle's kids it never had.<br />
However they looked more like small snake-wide green-gray dragons.<br />
<br />
...my own kid, Sophia, playing with my wife near the house,<br />
both smiling and sky so happy...<br />
<br />
Then the Glass collapsed.<br />
<br />
There was a room of people seating like students at stairs-like tables, me too.<br />
I have asked:<br />
<br />
- Does anyone know why the heck everything inside the Glass looked both real,<br />
but partially like in a HalfLife game?<br />
<br />
One of the "students" - my former colleague I was not communicating much with, answered:<br />
<br />
- You'd better learned how it works before trying to use it.<br />
It's no secret. Images are extracted from your brain, passed through the Corp mind,<br />
and extrapolated with something that should be relevant.<br />
It is your brain that used HalfLife rendering style for this, you buggy one.<br />
<br />
Students laughed. No problem being the Glitch. You remember the Vanellope von Schweetz, right?<br />
<br />
I felt myself stable and awoken.<br />
